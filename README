parse_dump.pl:

  parse_dump.pl parses all dump<#> files in the directory in which the script
  resides and generates csv files containing counts on inbound packets (e.g.
  tcp, udp, and web [port 80] packets).

*.csv

  These files contain counts on the type of packet indicated in their file
  name. Each line contains all inbound packets that were captured for the
  specific port or protocol since the timestamp on the previous line. The
  format is as follows:
